Random Notes: <br>
1] cannot record system audio, only surroudings <br>
2] Cookie-based Authentication is used. If users are loggined, a session cookie is assigned. Cookie-value is JWT token. While the authentication tries to detect cookies created to hack into the system, it's not sure if there is a certain format for JWT which hackers can emulate.
